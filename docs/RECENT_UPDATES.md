- **Enhanced Validation**: Updated duplicate detection logic for languages
- **Improved Constants**: Modified LANGUAGES array to include "None" as first option
- **Better Formatting**: Enhanced `formatLanguagesString()` to handle "None" special case

### State Management
- **Error Clearing**: Clear functions also reset related error states

## ðŸŽ¯ Priority Next Steps

### Challenge Rating (CR) System
**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT REMINDER**: The Challenge Rating calculation and validation system is the next critical feature to implement. This includes:

1. **Automatic CR Calculation**: Based on creature stats (AC, HP, damage output, save DCs)
2. **CR Validation**: Suggestions and warnings for inappropriate CR ratings
3. **XP Calculation**: Automatic experience point calculation based on CR
4. **Proficiency Bonus**: CR-based proficiency bonus calculation
5. **Stat Recommendations**: CR-appropriate stat suggestions

### Future Enhancements

## ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations

When testing the new features:
1. **Clear All Functions**: Test each clear button ensures proper reset behavior
2. **Language System**: Verify "None" option appears/disappears correctly
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Attempt to add duplicate languages and verify error handling
4. **State Persistence**: Clear sections, refresh page, verify state is maintained
5. **Custom Types**: Add custom types, clear sections, verify cleanup works
6. **Error States**: Test error clearing when using Clear All buttons

## ðŸ“Š Impact Analysis

### User Benefits
- **Faster Workflow**: Quick reset capability speeds up creature creation
- **Better Data Quality**: Duplicate prevention improves data integrity
- **Clearer Interface**: Smart button visibility reduces cognitive load
- **Enhanced Usability**: "None" language support handles edge cases properly

### Developer Benefits
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation of concerns in clear functions
- **Extensible System**: Easy to add clear functionality to future sections
- **Robust Validation**: Comprehensive error handling and state management
